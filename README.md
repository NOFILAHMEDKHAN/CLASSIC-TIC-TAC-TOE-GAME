Tic-Tac-Toe AI: Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning
📖 About
This project implements a Tic-Tac-Toe game featuring two powerful AI strategies:

Minimax Algorithm: Plays optimally by exploring all possible moves.

Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning: An optimized version that cuts off unnecessary branches, improving speed.

✨ Features
Playable Tic-Tac-Toe game (Human vs AI or AI vs AI).

AI decision-making using either Minimax or Alpha-Beta Pruning.

Choose to play as X (first player) or O (second player).

Compare the performance between Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning.

Simple and clean console-based interface.

🧠 How It Works
Minimax Algorithm:
Recursively evaluates all possible future moves to choose the optimal move, assuming both players play perfectly.

Alpha-Beta Pruning:
Optimizes Minimax by eliminating moves that won’t be selected, speeding up the decision-making process without affecting the result.

🕹️ How to Use
Run Tic-Tac-Toe AI: Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning.py.

Choose from the menu:

Play the game.

Compare Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning performance.

Follow the console instructions to input moves or watch AI play.


🎯 Learning Outcomes
Understand and implement the Minimax algorithm.

Apply Alpha-Beta pruning to optimize search trees.

Learn AI decision-making in simple games like Tic-Tac-Toe.
