# Tic-Tac-Toe AI: Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning

## About
This project implements a Tic-Tac-Toe game featuring two powerful AI strategies:

- **Minimax Algorithm**: Plays optimally by exploring all possible moves.
- **Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning**: An optimized version that cuts off unnecessary branches, improving speed.

## Features
- Playable Tic-Tac-Toe game (Human vs AI or AI vs AI).
- AI decision-making using either Minimax or Alpha-Beta Pruning.
- Choose to play as X (first player) or O (second player).
- Compare the performance between Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning.
- Simple and clean console-based interface.

## How It Works

### Minimax Algorithm
Recursively evaluates all possible future moves to choose the optimal move, assuming both players play perfectly.

### Alpha-Beta Pruning
Optimizes Minimax by eliminating moves that won’t be selected, speeding up the decision-making process without affecting the result.

## How to Use
1. Run `Tic-Tac-Toe AI: Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning.py`.
2. Choose from the menu:
   - Play the game.
   - Compare Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning performance.
3. Follow the console instructions to input moves or watch AI play.

## Learning Outcomes
- Understand and implement the Minimax algorithm.
- Apply Alpha-Beta pruning to optimize search trees.
- Learn AI decision-making in simple games like Tic-Tac-Toe.

## Future Improvements
- Add difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard).
- Create a GUI using Pygame or Tkinter.
- Expand the game to larger grids (4x4, 5x5).
- Add online multiplayer functionality.
- Implement move recommendation hints for players.
